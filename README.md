<center>Welcome!</center>

<p>This is where I'll keep all my Python projects that I've completed during my learning process. I'm still learning the hole GitHub thing, so things might be a little wonky right now. 
I will list each project I've completed in this readMe file, along with the amount of time it took to create it, the level of difficulty (subjective to...me), and a brief overview of my thoughts.</p>

| Project Name | Time | Difficulty | Thoughts |
| :----------: | :--: | :--------: | :------: |
| Basic Calculator | ~ 3 Days | Easy | This project was a really fun re-introduction into Python. I took an introductory Python course about 3 years ago in college, so I can recall the basics, such as object types, how to initialize functions, for/if/when loops and what-nots. I did not learn how to create a GUI though, and this was a great way to get to know the tkinter module. It's obviously not the most aesthetically pleasing calculator, but she's looking pretty ok! This was a great way to get me excited to make more.
